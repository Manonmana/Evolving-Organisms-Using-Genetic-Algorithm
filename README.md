# Evolving Organisms Using Genetic Algorithm

The objective of this Project is to simulate an organism in a hostile environment where the first generation is placed without any knowledge or guidance.
Through reinforcement learning and an application of genetic algorithm, the organisms learn to seek the beneficial ‘food’ and avoid the ‘poison’ through the generations.




## Appendix

- We create an environment which contains n Organisms and a fixed amount of foods and poisons scattered randomly.
- The Organisms have a DNA which decides how much they are attracted to or repelled by to the food and poison.
- The Organisms learn through the sacrifice of their ancestors to avoid poison and seek food. 
- The future generations are based on Genetic algorithm  with roulette wheel selection to pick the healthiest organisms as parents.
