# Evolving Organisms Using Genetic Algorithm

The objective of this Project is to simulate an organism in a hostile environment where the first generation is placed without any knowledge or guidance.
Through reinforcement learning and an application of genetic algorithm, the organisms learn to seek the beneficial â€˜foodâ€™ and avoid the â€˜poisonâ€™ through the generations.




## Appendix

- We create an environment which contains n Organisms and a fixed amount of foods and poisons scattered randomly.
- The Organisms have a DNA which decides how much they are attracted to or repelled by to the food and poison.
- The Organisms learn through the sacrifice of their ancestors to avoid poison and seek food. 
- The future generations are based on Genetic algorithm  with roulette wheel selection to pick the healthiest organisms as parents.
